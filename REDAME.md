## About

The project includes experiments on predicting properties from crystal structure by machine learning. Chemical properties such as Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity are predicted.

The repository includes modules for working with a chemical database, data processing, and generating chemical descriptors that can be used to train models.
You can also find here implementations of neural networks such as GCN, GAT, PointNet, Transformer.

The folder 'summary' includes experiment metrics. 


Training data is obtained from the following databases:
- [MPDS](https://mpds.io/#start)
- [Materials Project](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/)
